# DigiBingo
DigiBingo is a Python project which enables you to play Bingo online with friends. In each language(I have finished the Python versions, and am developing three C++ versions), there is one type that will use a text interface(in Python, DigiBingoText) and another which uses a GUI(in Python, DigiBingoGraphics).

I hope you enjoy playing DigiBingo with your friends(or even with yourself if you want!) and have fun!

The most recent version(DigiBingo V3), has a bug in the function askStr(Functions.cpp), and I am unsure how to fix it, so if you could help and provide a solution, I would greatly appreciate it(please add it as a issue or pull request). The function is meant to take in a string and display it with an input box, and return the input. Thanks in advance for all the helpðŸ™‚
