# DigiBingo
DigiBingo is a Python project which enables you to play Bingo online with friends. In each language(I have finished the Python versions, and am developing three C++ versions), there is one type that will use a text interface(in Python, DigiBingoText) and another which uses a GUI(in Python, DigiBingoGraphics).

I hope you enjoy playing DigiBingo with your friends(or even with yourself if you want!) and have fun!
