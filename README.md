# DigiBingo

DigiBingo is a Python project which enables you to play Bingo online with friends. In each language (the Python versions have been completed, three C++ versions are under development), there is one type which uses a text interface e.g. DigiBingoText, and another which uses a GUI e.g. DigiBingoGraphics.

I hope you enjoy playing DigiBingo with your friends (or even with yourself). Have fun!
